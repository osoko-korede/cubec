## E-commerce Excellence

Lumina Ventures sought to differentiate themselves in the sustainable products market through exceptional design and user experience. We created a platform that not only showcases their products beautifully but also drives conversions through thoughtful interaction design.

## Technical Implementation

- **Headless Commerce**: Integrated Shopify API with a custom Next.js frontend for maximum flexibility
- **Payment Processing**: Seamless Stripe integration with multiple payment methods
- **Product Discovery**: Advanced filtering and search capabilities powered by optimized database queries
- **Performance**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals with lazy loading and image optimization

## Results

The new platform achieved a 35% increase in average order value through improved product presentation and a streamlined checkout process that reduced cart abandonment by 22%.
