## Project Overview

WishWeaver is a modern platform designed to bridge the gap between users and their aspirations. Our approach combined user research, intuitive interface design, and scalable backend architecture to create an engaging digital experience.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Dashboard**: Users can track, manage, and share their wishes with a beautiful, responsive interface
- **Social Integration**: Built-in sharing and collaboration features allow users to connect with friends and family
- **Real-time Updates**: Leveraging Supabase real-time capabilities for instant data synchronization
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully optimized for all device sizes with touch-friendly interactions

## Design Philosophy

The design process focused on simplicity and delight. We created a visual language that feels approachable yet sophisticated, with smooth animations and intuitive navigation patterns that guide users through their wish fulfillment journey.
